# Restaurant POS SaaS - Frontend

This project is the frontend for a modern, minimalist Point of Sale (POS) system designed for restaurants. It's built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features (Planned & In-Progress)

*   **Beautiful & Minimalist UI:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
*   **Order Management:** Taking orders, item selection, modifiers.
*   **Table Management:** Visual layout of tables, status updates.
*   **Menu Display:** Browse menu items and categories.
*   **Payment Processing UI:** Interface for handling payments (no actual processing yet).
*   **Kitchen Display:** A view for kitchen staff to see incoming orders.
*   **User Authentication:** Login screen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or ensure you have the generated files):**
    ```bash
    # If you had cloned a repo, otherwise skip if files were generated directly
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd restaurant-pos-saas
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

```
/public
  index.html          # Main HTML file
  manifest.json       # Web app manifest
  ...
/src
  App.tsx             # Main application component with routing
  index.tsx           # Entry point of the React application
  index.css           # Global styles and Tailwind directives
  /components         # Reusable UI components (to be further developed)
  /pages              # Top-level page components (embedded in App.tsx for now)
  /assets             # Static assets like images, icons (to be added)
  /contexts           # React contexts for state management (to be added)
  /hooks              # Custom React hooks (to be added)

```

## Next Steps

*   Refine UI components for a more polished look and feel.
*   Implement state management (e.g., using React Context or a library like Zustand/Redux Toolkit) for orders, tables, etc.
*   Develop more detailed components for each feature (e.g., menu item cards, order line items, payment modal).
*   Add more interactivity and form handling.
*   Create actual `pages` and `components` directories and move relevant code.
*   Connect to a backend API (once available).

This provides a foundational structure. You can now run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) and then `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to see the basic application.
